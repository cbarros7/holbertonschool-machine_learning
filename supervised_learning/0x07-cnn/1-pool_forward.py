    Args:
        A_prev: is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, h_prev, w_prev, c_prev)
                containing the output of the previous layer
            m: is the number of examples
            h_prev: is the height of the previous layer
            w_prev: is the width of the previous layer
            c_prev: is the number of channels in the previous layer

        kernel_shape: is a tuple of (kh, kw) containing the size of the
                kernel for the pooling
            kh is the kernel height
            kw is the kernel width

                for the pooling
            sh is the stride for the height
            sw is the stride for the width
